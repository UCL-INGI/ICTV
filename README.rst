ICTV is a simple content management system for digital signage on multiple screens.

It is a web application written in Python. Everything from the management of the content to its reproduction on
screens happens in a web browser.
ICTV is easily extendable, with a simple and powerful plugin system.

ICTV is currently used at UCLouvain_ and is deployed on 22 screens throughout the campus.
